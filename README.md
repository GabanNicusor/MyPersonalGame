# MyPersonalGame
This is a simple 2D game.

It is a single-player game where you have to try not to die.

The game is not done and I do have to implement new features.

Use the keyboard buttons A and D to move left and right.
Use space to jump and click to attack.
Press Enter to enter in the game.
Press back-space to return to the menu
Press R to Reload the player to the main position
